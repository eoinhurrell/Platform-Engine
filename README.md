#Platform Engine - a game engine in Lua

This is a personal project from a week-long experiment in learning and using Lua. It makes use of LOVE2D, a Lua 2D game engine, to build a platform engine. It's not very advanced, and remains unfinished, but was useful in learning Lua, engine design and some game-specific problem areas (collision detection etc.).
